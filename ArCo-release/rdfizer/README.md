# RDFizer
This software implements the workflow for generating the Linked Open Data of the ArCo project.
The workflow relies on an XSLT processing that enables the conversion of the original dataset, which consists of a collection of XML cotalogue records.
The XSLT sheet used by the software is the file `arco.xslt` and can be found in the folder `./src/main/resources/META-INF/xslt`.

### Requirements 
RDFizer is implemented as a Java 8 project with Maven support.

### Build
To build the software use Maven by typing the following command in the terminal having the root of the project as base folder:
```
$> mvn clean install
```

Once the build process fininshes the executable JAR named `arco.rdfizer-0.1.jar` can be found under the folder `target`.

If the XLST sheet is modified, then the software needs to be rebuilt again.

### Usage
The JAR named arco.rdfizer-0.1.jar can be executed in a terminal.
The command synopsis is the following:
```
$> java -jar arco.rdfizer-0.1.jar [OPTIONS] XML_FILE
```
Where the argument `XML_FILE` must be replaced with the path of the actual XML that needs to be converted to RDF.
The options are the following:
 - -o,--output <file>:  it allows to specify a file to use as the target destination for the output RDF generated by the application;
 - -s,--syntax <string>: it allows to specify the RDF syntax to use for the serialisation of the output. Acceptable values are RDF/XML, TURTLE, N-TRIPLES, JSON-LD, RDF/JSON, and N3. If no explicit value is specified, then the default syntax is TURTLE.

### Example
The following command convert the XML catalogue record named `ICCD10006679.xml` to RDF. Additionally, it saves the resulting RDF to the file named `ICCD10006679.jsonld` by using the JSON-LD syntax.
```
java -jar arco.rdfizer-0.1.jar -s JSON-LD ICCD10006679.xml
```

### Testing RDFizer

Test cases for the RDFizer can be provided as a single CSV file. 
A row of the CSV file represents a test case where: the first colunmn of the row is the absolute path of the input XML file and the second column is the absolute path of the expected RDF file.

```
/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234971.xml,/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234971.ttl
/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234972.xml,/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234972.ttl
/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234973.xml,/Users/lgu/Desktop/ICCD2234973.ttl
```

The test case is passed when the RDF file generated by the RDFizer using the XML as input is isomorphic to the RDF file provided.
